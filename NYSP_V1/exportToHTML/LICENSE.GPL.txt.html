<a name="l43"><span class="ln">43   </span></a>  <span class="s0">The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</span>
<a name="l44"><span class="ln">44   </span></a><span class="s0">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</span>
<a name="l45"><span class="ln">45   </span></a><span class="s0">License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</span>
<a name="l46"><span class="ln">46   </span></a><span class="s0">software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</span>
<a name="l47"><span class="ln">47   </span></a><span class="s0">General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</span>
<a name="l48"><span class="ln">48   </span></a><span class="s0">Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to</span>
<a name="l49"><span class="ln">49   </span></a><span class="s0">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</span>
<a name="l50"><span class="ln">50   </span></a><span class="s0">the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</span>
<a name="l51"><span class="ln">51   </span></a><span class="s0">your programs, too.</span>
<a name="l52"><span class="ln">52   </span></a>
<a name="l53"><span class="ln">53   </span></a>  <span class="s0">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</span>
<a name="l54"><span class="ln">54   </span></a><span class="s0">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</span>
<a name="l55"><span class="ln">55   </span></a><span class="s0">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</span>
<a name="l56"><span class="ln">56   </span></a><span class="s0">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</span>
<a name="l57"><span class="ln">57   </span></a><span class="s0">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</span>
<a name="l58"><span class="ln">58   </span></a><span class="s0">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</span>
<a name="l59"><span class="ln">59   </span></a>
<a name="l60"><span class="ln">60   </span></a>  <span class="s0">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</span>
<a name="l61"><span class="ln">61   </span></a><span class="s0">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</span>
<a name="l62"><span class="ln">62   </span></a><span class="s0">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</span>
<a name="l63"><span class="ln">63   </span></a><span class="s0">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</span>
<a name="l64"><span class="ln">64   </span></a>
<a name="l65"><span class="ln">65   </span></a>  <span class="s0">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span>
<a name="l66"><span class="ln">66   </span></a><span class="s0">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</span>
<a name="l67"><span class="ln">67   </span></a><span class="s0">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</span>
<a name="l68"><span class="ln">68   </span></a><span class="s0">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</span>
<a name="l69"><span class="ln">69   </span></a><span class="s0">rights.</span>
<a name="l70"><span class="ln">70   </span></a>
<a name="l71"><span class="ln">71   </span></a>  <span class="s0">We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</span>
<a name="l72"><span class="ln">72   </span></a><span class="s0">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</span>
<a name="l73"><span class="ln">73   </span></a><span class="s0">distribute and/or modify the software.</span>
<a name="l74"><span class="ln">74   </span></a>
<a name="l75"><span class="ln">75   </span></a>  <span class="s0">Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain</span>
<a name="l76"><span class="ln">76   </span></a><span class="s0">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</span>
<a name="l77"><span class="ln">77   </span></a><span class="s0">software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</span>
<a name="l78"><span class="ln">78   </span></a><span class="s0">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</span>
<a name="l79"><span class="ln">79   </span></a><span class="s0">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</span>
<a name="l80"><span class="ln">80   </span></a><span class="s0">authors' reputations.</span>
<a name="l81"><span class="ln">81   </span></a>
<a name="l82"><span class="ln">82   </span></a>  <span class="s0">Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</span>
<a name="l83"><span class="ln">83   </span></a><span class="s0">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</span>
<a name="l84"><span class="ln">84   </span></a><span class="s0">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</span>
<a name="l85"><span class="ln">85   </span></a><span class="s0">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</span>
<a name="l86"><span class="ln">86   </span></a><span class="s0">patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</span>

<a name="l107"><span class="ln">107  </span></a><span class="s0">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</span>

<a name="l109"><span class="ln">109  </span></a><span class="s0">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</span>

<a name="l143"><span class="ln">143  </span></a>    <span class="s0">does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</span>
<a name="l144"><span class="ln">144  </span></a>    <span class="s0">the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</span>
<a name="l145"><span class="ln">145  </span></a>
<a name="l146"><span class="ln">146  </span></a><span class="s0">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</span>

<a name="l150"><span class="ln">150  </span></a><span class="s0">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</span>
<a name="l151"><span class="ln">151  </span></a><span class="s0">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</span>
<a name="l152"><span class="ln">152  </span></a><span class="s0">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span>

<a name="l214"><span class="ln">214  </span></a><span class="s0">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</span>
<a name="l215"><span class="ln">215  </span></a><span class="s0">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</span>
<a name="l216"><span class="ln">216  </span></a><span class="s0">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</span>
<a name="l217"><span class="ln">217  </span></a><span class="s0">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span>

<a name="l236"><span class="ln">236  </span></a><span class="s0">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</span>

<a name="l238"><span class="ln">238  </span></a><span class="s0">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</span>
<a name="l239"><span class="ln">239  </span></a><span class="s0">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</span>
